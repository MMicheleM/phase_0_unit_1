# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	
	It's an agnostic way of representing and being able to interact with html documents and their associated css and javascript. The tree structure makes sense to me as does the general concept of being able to live edit a site. Seeing the "compilation" of sources to help understand how the various docs are interacting with each other makes good sense to me/seems like a "pro".  Not sure what seems bad about it other than it's clearly intended for more advanced users. (If you're code knowledge is how to operate a WYSIWYG this isn't a tool that you'll really be able to use.)

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

	They didn't really. My site is nascient and has no css (at the moment) or scripts. So the "tree" is rather one-dimensional. The WordPress site on the other hand was full of scripting, had css, is what I suspect we're aiming towards with the work we'll be doing on our pages.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

	A bit of all of the above. At times I had trouble navigating (e.g. scrolling down/up in a list) Mostly it seemed somewhat fun. I think the learning is to remember that editing in element (vs. source) means you lose changes if page reloads - can be painful I would imagine if you're not careful.
 
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	
	I think that there were many parts of it that helped solidify the parent/child concept for me when it came to browsers/html/css. Watching the layering of the various compononents of the page also was helpful. I'm envisioning this being an on-going "aha" type of tool for me. One where the more I use it the more things I'll discover I understand/understand more fully. Which I think is very exciting!


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	No, once again y'all provided more than enough to make my head explode in a good way. :)
