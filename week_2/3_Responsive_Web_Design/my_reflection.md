# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.



Ressponsive web design is the approach to web design that aims to make a site render "appropriately" given the platform on which it's being viewed (desktop/laptop vs. tablet/netbook vs. smart phone)  I love it when it's executed well. All too often being "responsive" seems to be serving up an incredibly watered down version of a site (on smart phones) with a link to the "full site." I think it's a great practice when executed correctly and even when executed not so elegantly it's better than a site not set up to accomodate smart phones or tablets or...


Smartphones and tablets have forced designers/companies/etc. to rethink their web presence. In some cases it's resulted in separate sites or even stand alone apps (e.g. Amazon) that are specific to a platform.

[IDEAS/CONCEPTS THAT HAVE RESONATED WITH ME]

Resources on my own... nope, just keepin up with what y'all have given us (and checking out the references that cohortmates have shared) have kept me busy. Maybe when I'm not also juggling a full time job I'll have time to find (and share) other resources.
