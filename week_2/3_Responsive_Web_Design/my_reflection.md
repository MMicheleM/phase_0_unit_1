# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

	Responsive web design is the approach to web design that aims to make a site render "appropriately" given the platform on which it's being viewed (desktop/laptop vs. tablet/netbook vs. smart phone)  I love it when it's executed well. All too often being "responsive" seems to be serving up an adaptive version (often incredibly watered down) of a site (on smart phones) with a link to the "full site." I think it's a great practice when executed correctly and even when executed not so elegantly it's better than a site not set up to accommodate smart phones or tablets or...

	Smartphones and tablets have forced designers/companies/etc. to rethink their web presence. In some cases it's resulted in separate sites or even stand alone apps (e.g. Amazon) that are specific to a platform.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

	I believe they use them in a variety of ways - some use a text reader others use some seriously cool magnification setups (am thinking of a 90 y.o. woman who's apartment I've been in - she was legally blind and yet her setup allowed her to navigate a lot of the web rather well.) To the degree that they have resources available to them and to the extent that the sites/applications they're trying to use have been designed for visual impairment they can use the web. However in many cases one or both of those conditions do not exist. Yes, we should absolutely design and develop for them - and as an added bonus the thought behind a well designed/developed site/app can make for a better UX for non-visually impaired users.	

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

	How relatively straightforward responsive design is. It had seemed like the bogeyman to me given some challenges we've experienced with it in my current workplace. (I'm not exposed to the code/build out of the pages so it was just hearing about pain of execution from others.) Now I suspect the limitation is not with the complexity of the concept but rather the platform in which those pages are being built. What I haven't heard/read a lot about is anything related to A/B testing - which surely must happen. But perhaps only on larger more commercial sites. My exposure to A/B testing has been limited to the fundraising world and thus e-mails and landing/donation pages but nevertheless it's an invaluable tool. Seems to me like you'd want to test for usability with true users not just internal assessment.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	Resources on my own... nope, just keeping up with what y'all have given us (and checking out the references that cohortmates have shared) has kept me busy. Maybe when I'm not also juggling a full time job I'll have time to find (and share) other resources.
