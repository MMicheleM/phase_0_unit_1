# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


Web standards and a phenomenal thing - I can't imagine the web without them. Specifically I cannot fathom how one could target other users without them.


The standard structure does make sense to me - it's a top to bottom left to right sort of thing which is a western way of reading (which is how I read) and thus intuitive. I can see how it might be more confusing for those whose reading layout it back to front bottom right to top left.

In general I do like the semanitc tags as they seem based off solid research (looking at millions of sites worth of code to identify the common denominators) I'm still working on understanding the limitations as there undoubtedly are some but at the moment as a novice coder their intuitive naming seems like a great thing.

Reset.css allows for cross-browser compatability by wiping browser defaults and starting from a common point.

Browsers I'm currently using are Safari, Google and Firefox. I've also used IE (on a pc) Things can definitely render differently from browser to browser and while there may be a "pro" to this all I can see is the "con" whereby trying to optimize a site can really lead to some headaches. At the very least it leads to add'l time spent in the QC process.

I did land on a variety of webpages in my quest to better understand certain things but didn't track them. Self challenge to remember to do so... we shall see.
