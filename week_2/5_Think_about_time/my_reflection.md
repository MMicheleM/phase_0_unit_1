# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?



At present working full time during the week and being a parent on the weekend. That doesn't leave a lot of time for school - never mind any "me" or "down" time. Pacing myself through the week is still very much a work in progress. Fortunately the last 4 weeks of Phase 0 will be work free - so mostly I'm focused on just trying to keep up until I feel like I can breathe (i.e. after my job wraps up.)

I'm trying to get good about using what time I have during the week. I've been getting up and into work earlier so I can get home earlier and get better quality time in with the Phase 0 materials before the natural end of day exhaustion sets in. It's a bit of culture shock so I'm still figuring it out. And I need to put in some deliberate "fun"... as I'll only experience decreasing productivity otherwise.

Techniques to try will included adding in meditation (something I've been trying to to do for a little over a year and reading the one article this week made me want to recommit to really trying to turn it into a habit), also the methodology of BJ Fogg's really hit home - focusing on triggers to change behaviors. The Motivation + Ability + Trigger = Behavior makes good plain sense. For me it would be identifying the triggers as well as the behaviors (i.e. I know I want to learn and do well with DBC/coding but what exactly are the behaviors I need to work on. And can I work on triggers for new learned behaviors which I think would be easier than trying to hit his black path (permanent change) which I suspect would be a great deal harder.)

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to get better at time management and focus while I'm still working full time and then figuring out a rigorous (but balanced!) schedule for myself for the last four weeks of Phase 0. I need to weave some fun into those four weeks as the last six years at my workplace have been hard and I need to feel recharged before I take on the mountain know as DBC Phase 1 (through 3.)  Laughter and joy are also part of the plan. And chocolate, always chocolate. (And more caffeine than I usually allow myself.)
