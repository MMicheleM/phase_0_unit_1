My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.





[WHAT DID I LEARN]


I do like design and user experience though I still feel woefully ignorant on both accounts. However I feel like I've got a foundation going and I anticipate spending more time (whether Phase 0 or post-DBC I'm not sure) on both areas as it's the blend of creative with logical that I enjoy and find there to be limited opportunities to meld in such a full way. 

[What was my process...  Read the material, visualize a rough outline and wireframe it then fall down a lot of rabbit holes... ]
