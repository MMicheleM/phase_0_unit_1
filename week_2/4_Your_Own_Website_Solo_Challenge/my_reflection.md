# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://MMicheleM.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

	That I have a lot left to learn. There are many things about design that seem cool and yet must be weighed against functionality, accessibility, etc. User experience is more intuitive in that I think clean/simple design is the new norm and what the focus needs to be on is responsiveness and functionality. Which doesn't mean you ignore the pretty, you just get smarter about it.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

	I do like design and user experience though I still feel woefully ignorant on both fronts. However I feel like I've got a decent foundation going and I anticipate spending more time (whether Phase 0 or post-DBC I'm not sure) on both areas as it's the blend of creative with logical that I enjoy and find there to be limited opportunities to meld in such a full way. 

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

	Read the material, visualize a rough outline and wireframe it then fall down a lot of rabbit holes... Get frustrated, take breaks. Have a victory and feel like I know my material. What worked were things I'm comfortable with (padding, margins, etc.) what didn't work was icon font. I thought I understood how to link to awesome font in my head section and then insert the icons but I was sorely mistaken. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	
	Want to figure out icon font stuff. Need to add responsive design to it - I ran out of time to include it in my code. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

	Other than icon font things went pretty well. Pretty much everything we're learning right now is super cool to me - but not any one thing more than another.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	Nope.
