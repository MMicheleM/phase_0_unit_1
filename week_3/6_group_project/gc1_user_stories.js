// USER STORIES

// I want to have two groups of numbers: 
// 	a. one group containing 7 numbers (using values 1-7)
// 	b. one group containing 8 numbers (using values 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6 and 7)

// And I want a way to know each of the following:
// 	a. the total of each group (call/name the way of knowing this: sum)
// 	b. the average of each group (call/name it: mean)
// 	c. the middle-most number for each group (call/name it: median)




// * What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
	// Hard to ansswer this one as I had no real strategy other than
	// "Get it done." There was some initial confusion in that the person before
	// me had actually done more of a pseduo-code than a user story. Which
	// was only a minor problem until I checked in with them and we swapped roles.

// * What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
	//No questions per se "while coding" but understanding how to read tests and research on
	//assert wree part of my process. Googling for assert and reading Mozilla's article on it helped.

// * What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
	//None really. The story telling was a stretch in trying to keep it in true layperson terms but
	// otherwise it was fun.

// * Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	//I would say I now have working knowledge of TDD and of writing a story.

// * How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 
	// To the degree that they were a part of the work I did I feel solid.
	
// * Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
	// Learning about tests, how to read them and turn them into user stories.

// * Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	// None really.
