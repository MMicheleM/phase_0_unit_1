Short Intro
Name: Michele Murphy

Location: Oakland, CA (for the last 17 years with time spent in various other cities in the SF Bay Area as well as Hawaii and Colorado in my youth. And and fabulous year in London, England after I finished college (which was back before the Earth's crust cooled when dinosaurs still roamed. ;-))

Favorite websites (for purposes of exercise) google.com, neechathai.com and etsy.com

Learning style is multimodal and I'm evidently an abstract random thinker. Seems to boil down to a lot of trial and error, loud music, occasional cursing and the victory arms whenever I get code to work. \o/



Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 


While I'm sorry others are feeling pain too I was somewhat relieved as it helped me feel like I wasn't the only one struggling - with content and/or pacing myself. I look forward to getting to know people better and being able to hopefully provide support and to get better about asking for help. I'm the epitome of an introvert and am also shy (not the same thing) and while I can fake it well I reserve that for social gatherings in person. Online I tend to stay true to my stripes but I recognize the limitations that I thus impose on myself. So ongoing challenge for next 8 weeks (and let me be honest here, the rest of my life) is to reach out more both with help as well as asking for it.
