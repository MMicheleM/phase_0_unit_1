## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

No struggles that I'm aware of setting up git and GitHub - though I suppose that remains to be seen. :)

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to a "document" (for a non-tech audience I suppose I'd use the MS Word "track changes" analogy) - it can save you from yourself by allowing you to back track and undo changes you've made to the document. It also allows changes made by multiple users simultaneously - if you're using an extersonal repository for change control such as GitHub. You can use git locally but I'm hard pressed to see why you would want to - other than if you're working in an area with no internet connection. 

Version control allows you to revert back to a certain time/place. GitHub tracks the changes, letting you see the who/when/how/what/why of a change - and thus allows you to select that which you'd like to "undo".

I think the biggest win for developers is that you can have multiple people working on different aspects of a program without them having to wait on another person to complete their work and/or having someone change (or heaven forfend delete) their code. Yes it makes perfect sense to me and is much more elegant and safe than trying to remember to save versions of some project yourself - which is just an accident waiting to happen.

Right now the GitHub interface doesn't make sense insomuch as I haven't had much interaction with it but I believe time/usage will quickly change that. Also what the various commands/lingo/etc. mean - again, suspect that will no longer be a concern very soon. (The general concepts of merge, fork, commit, etc. seem to resonate so maybe I'm fine.) What does make sense to me is how wonderful version control is. And in this case it seems like it's akin to a beautiful audit trail in a relational db - makes one's heart sing with joy when you've got a good one.
