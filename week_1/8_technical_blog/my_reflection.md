## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://mmichelem.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?


I enjoy blogging - it's always a question of having enough time and sadly this exercise was no different as it's Sunday afternoon and I'm scrambling to finish the rest of this week's assignments. No comments or views as of posting the reflection as the blog has just gone up. The blog was good in helping me to focus on usability and design (not to be confused with design thinking ;-)) It wasn't cumbersome at all. Felt best about knowing what I like about a good UI and/or UX. Less certain about market research around it all. Also unhappy with myself that I wasn't able to pace my workload this week such that I wasn't sprinting toward the finish line. Next four weeks will continue to test me on the timing of my exercises but fortunately after that I'll have four weeks devoted to nothing but learning and excercises before hitting phase 1.
