## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Not so much new but a good reminder that I tend to use the word internet incorrectly. Um, hmm... second one - ok, can't quote it but the fact that domains are "tiered" - I had always thought it was the whole address e.g. "google.com" but .com is at a more meta level. And the fact that IP addresses are moving from (some numerical notation) to another (numerical notation) thus adding what seemed like a zillion new IP addresses was interesting. (Also frightening the idea that my fridge would some day be tweeting. I'll take my flying car that folds up into a suitcase first please.)

Frequency of update really guides/defines whether it's a web site or a web application.

Giddy. (There was squealing I will not lie.)

No "aha"s or concept solidification come to mind. 

Sadly I did not - I suspect this is something I should plan on doing (as you're now asking us repeadedly :)) Will try and do a bit more on this front in the next few weeks but I'm still working full-time so until I'm on the other side of that (May 23) I'm just trying to keep up and understand what I'm working with/on.
