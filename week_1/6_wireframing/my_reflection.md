## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?


I liked thinking about what works (for me at least as an end consumer) but now that I have some idea of the code behind a page I have to say it made my head hurt. So the ideation part is/would be fun. And the figuring out how to make it all work also fun. Just a new respect for the level of complexity of something that used to a flatter, simpler world. :)  It's been a good exercise to think front end vs. back end as the wireframing (at least as I did it) laid out the interface but did not speak to things like databases, search alorithms, randomizers, etc. that are at play on the back end.
