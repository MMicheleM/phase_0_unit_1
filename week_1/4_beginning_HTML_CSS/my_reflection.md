## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


HTML, the basics, seems all fairly straightfoward - it hasn't chnaged much since the mid-1990s. The more nuanced aspects of it are still a learning curve for me. Where I got a bit lost was in the (possible) need to next divs in order to have a multi-column layout - which is a bit more about CSS than HTMAL.

Good about HTML: easy to write, easy to read. 
Bad about HTML: browser compatability issues. Not very flexible for design.

Aha moments were more on the CSS front. Oh and in linking to images - the .. before /images proved to be the key to image rendering in one case. I've managed to get my page to layout correctly and understand the need around the math (i.e. include width plus padding and/or margins) however if I had to turn around and teach the concept tomorrow I think I'd be a) missing stuff and b) be b.s.ing my way through what I think is happening.  Some of the aha moments also came from running the hmtl through validation site (thanks to Avi Fox-Rosen for the link!)
