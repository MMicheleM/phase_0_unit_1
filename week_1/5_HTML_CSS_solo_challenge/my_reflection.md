## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?



What questions... 1) how does this lay out, 2) pixels vs. percent for spacing, 3) color palate, 4) absolute and relative vis-a-vis what? (i.e. what are they anchoring off... I had thought container which seems to sometimes be true but my img caption seems to be absolute to img?) 5) how come I seem to be doing "new math" when adding margin/padding/width/etc., 6) OMG, will I ever complete this?!!?

Concepts that are making my head asplode: positioning - while I get the general concepts sometimes my math doesn't add up (i.e. margin plus padding plus width...) and yet it renders visually correct. I had trouble remembering div id vs class until I couldn't get some styling correct and then that registered that I could make font pretty in a class but needed to address alignment within the id. 

Skills learned - I had already unknowingly done a lot of this same work in the previous exerceise so I'm not certain I learned new skills and if new values (e.g. small-caps) count then yep, learned quite a few of those.

Confidence level: I'd give myself an 70% confidence on the overall concept of positioning HTML elements using CSS - or at least my skills in doing so. It's something I need to spend more time playing with to get it to lock. Using HTML tags I'm 100% confident about what I know however I suspect what I know is like 5% of HTML tags. :P

I really enjoyed the debugging (about 85% of the time - the other 15% was the "back away from the keyboard slowly" moments) in large part because that's how I learn. "Why isn't this centered?"(Try five different things and find answer.)

Tedious was trying to position caption *above* image. Not sure I did it right with a negative value but it seems to be rendering nicely. Also tedious was the "new math" I seem to have done to get things to render (position wise) correctly. Flummoxed by that bit still.
